        <h1>KING</h1>
        <img src="assest/king.jpeg" >
        <p>The king (♔, ♚) is the most important piece in the game of chess. 
         It may move to any adjoining square; it may also perform, in tandem with the rook, a special move called castling.
         If a player's king is threatened with capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove or evade the threat of capture immediately, such as by moving it away from the attacked square. 
         If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player. A player cannot make any move that places their own king in check. Despite this, 
         the king can become a strong offensive piece in the endgame or, rarely, the middlegame</p>

         <p >
            The queen (♕, ♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess. It can move any number of squares vertically, 
         horizontally or diagonally, combining the powers of the rook and bishop. Each player starts the game with one queen, 
         placed in the middle of the first rank next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece, 
         a pawn is promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases; 
         if a pawn is promoted to a piece other than a queen, it is an underpromotion.</p>

         <img src="assest/rook 2.jpeg" alt="">
         <p>The rook (/rʊk/; ♖, ♜) is a piece in the game of chess. It may move any number of squares horizontally or vertically without jumping, 
            and it may capture an enemy piece on its path; it may participate i
            n castling. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each corner on their side of the board.
         Formerly, the rook (from Persian: romanized: rokh/rukh, lit. 'chariot')[1][2][3] was alternatively called the tower, marquess, rector,
          and comes (count or earl).[4] The term "castle" is considered to be informal or old-fashioned</p>

           It moves and captures along diagonals without jumping over 
           interfering pieces. Each player begins the game with two
           bishops. The starting squares are c1 and f1 for White's 
           bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.</p>

             represented by a horse's head and neck. It moves two squares 
             vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally 
             and one square vertically, jumping over other pieces. Each player
             starts the game with two knights on the b- and 
             g-files, each located between a rook and a bishop.</p>

                The pawn (♙, ♟) is the most numerous and weakest piece in the game of
                 chess. It may move one vacant square directly forward, 
                 it may move one or two vacant squares directly forward on
                 its first move, and it may capture one square diagonally forward. 
                 Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each 
                 square of their second rank. The white pawns start on a2
                  through h2; the black pawns start on a7 through h7.
