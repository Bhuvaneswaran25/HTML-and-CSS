         <p>Aggregor manages to reach the Forge of Creation and the team pursues him.
            They are nearly defeated by Aggregor, but Kevin, as a last resort,
            absorbs the powers of the Ultimatrix and is able to defeat Aggregor, absorbing his powers in the process.
            Unfortunately,
            the absorption of too much power overwhelms Kevin, leading him to insanity and an unquenchable thirst for
            more power.
            This leads to a stand-off between him and Ben, who, after failed attempts at tracking and saving Kevin,
            resolves to kill Kevin to prevent him from hurting anyone. But with the aid of Gwen, he is able to instead
            remove Kevin's absorbed powers,
            saving him and restoring the five aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy back to life.</p>

         <p>Ultimate Cannonbolt has powers similar to Cannonbolt's, although his shell is now much thicker and metallic,
            increasing his defensive capabilities. His plates are also covered with studs that turn into spikes when in
            sphere form,
            which increase his offensive capabilities. These powers combined make Ultimate Cannonbolt even more
            unstoppable when in his sphere form,
            as he has more traction and won't lose as much momentum;
            is more maneuverable; and can more easily crush obstacles in his way.</p> <br>

         <p>Ultimate Big Chill looks mostly the same as his regular form in Alien Force and Ultimate Alien except his
            skin is recolored red,
            his wings and antennae have a flame design, and he had crests over his eyes with the same design. Similar to
            Big Chill,
            Ultimate Big Chill can make his wings and antennae fold into a cloak.</p>

         <p>Ultimate Echo Echo has a tall blue body with black stripes, an overall rounded design, long arms and legs,
            and stumped feet.
            He is not a robot or containment suit, despite his body now looking more metallic.[note 1] Unlike his
            devolved counterpart,
            Ultimate Echo Echo has fifteen blue, removable speaker-like components attached to his body and a marking on
            his back resembling
            a cassette tape.
            Ultimate Echo Echo wears the evolved Ultimatrix symbol on his chest.</p>

         <p>Ultimate Spidermonkey has a large gorilla-like body with purple skin, black fur and three pairs of eyes.
            He lacks Spidermonkey's tail and extra pair of arms, but they are replaced with two pairs of retractable
            spider legs that can fold into his waist.

         <p>Ultimate Humungousaur is exponentially stronger than Humungousaur,
            even being able to fight off Vilgax's army of Bioids transformed as Humungousaur.
            He is also strong enough to lift and throw a To'kustar,[4] and rupture the ground by just punching it.</p>

         <p>Ultimate Swampfire has the appearance of a humanoid tree instead of a walking plant like Swampfire.
            Ultimate Swampfire's body is dark brown in color, and now has three blue gooey shells containing an organic,
            blue-colored gel-like solution of kerosene napalm on each of his arms and a large one on his back.
            He also has a smaller pod on his front, through which his face can be seen.
            Ultimate Swampfire's body is composed of petrified wood.
