            <p>A species of Scary Dogmatic Aliens who attempt to invade Earth in season 1 and 2 of Ben 10: Alien Force. 
                Highbreed believe themselves to be the first, and therefore genetically purest, species in the Universe, and that all other 
                living beings are inferiors that need to be exterminated like vermin. While powerful on their own, they are unwilling to have direct 
                contact with other species, and instead use genetically engineered Mooks, the DNAliens, to do their dirty work.</p> <br>

            <p>Echo Echo is a small, white humanoid made of silicon.
              His body is natural; although he strongly resembles a robot, he is neither it nor an animated containment suit.
             One of his most noticeable features is a square appendage resembling an MP3 player behind his back with a port on it,
              decorated with a 10 symbol and what looks like cassette tapes on his lower legs. 
             The green circle-shaped indents on the back of Echo Echo's hands are sound holes which help him resonate,
             and the inside of his mouth is also green with lines that give it the appearance of an amplifier. 
             He also wears headphones so he would not be hurt by his own sonic screams. 
             The headphones are attached to the appendage on his back.</p> <br>
